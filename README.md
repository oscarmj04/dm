# 📱 Mobile Task Manager – Assignment 4

This repository contains the implementation for **Assignment 4** of the Task Manager App project.

## 🎯 Assignment Goal

_Build your first Android application using Kotlin._

_Reuse the object-oriented model from Week 03 (Task and Category)._

_Implement a single-activity app that allows users to add new tasks and mark existing tasks as done._

_Manage the task list in memory using a MutableList<Task>._

_Simplify architecture before introducing ViewModel in future weeks._
## ✅ Implemented Features

- **Task.kt** – defines the Task data class reused from Week 03.
- **Category.kt** – defines the Category enum for task classification.
- **MainActivity.kt** – main Activity handling task creation, updates, and display logic.
- **activity_main.xml** – layout defining the UI elements (title, task list, inputs, and buttons).

## 🚧 Known Issues


## 📝 Notes
- Logic and UI handling occur directly inside the Activity for simplicity.
- _Specify any libraries used._
